Accordingly, we reserve the right to cancel, reduce or delete any pending plays, whether placed with funds resulting from the error or not.

General Rules

If a sport-specific rule contradicts a general rule, then the general rule will not apply.

The winner of an event will be determined on the date of the event’s settlement; we do not recognize protested or overturned decisions for wagering purposes. The result of an event suspended after the start of competition will be decided according to the wagering rules specified for that sport by us.

All results posted shall be final after 72 hours and no queries will be entertained after that period of time. Within 72 hours after results are posted, the company will only reset/correct the results due to human error, system error or mistakes made by the referring results source.

Minimum and maximum wager amounts on all sporting events will be determined by us and are subject to change without prior written notice. We also reserve the right to adjust limits on individual Accounts as well.

Customers are solely responsible for their own Account transactions. Please be sure to review your wagers for any mistakes before sending them in. Once a transaction is complete, it cannot be changed. We do not take responsibility for missing or duplicate wagers made by the Customer and will not entertain discrepancy requests because a play is missing or duplicated. Customers may review their transactions in the My Account section of the site after each session to ensure all requested wagers were accepted.

For a wager to have action on any named contestant in a Yes/No Proposition, the contestant must enter and compete in the event.

A game/match will have action regardless of the League heading that is associated with the matchup. For example, two teams from the same League are playing in a Cup competition. If the matchup is mistakenly placed in the League offering, the game/match will still have action, as long as the matchup is correct. In other words, a matchup will have action as long as the two teams are correct, and regardless of the League header in which it is placed on our Website.

If an event is not played on the same date as announced by the governing body, then all wagers on the event have no action. If an event is posted by us, with an incorrect date, all wagers have action based on the date announced by the governing body.

cassinopix.com reserves the right to remove events, markets and any other product from the website. cassinopix.com reserves the right to restrict the casino access of any player without prior notice.

In all futures wagering (for example, total season wins, Super Bowl winner, etc.), the winner as determined by the Governing Body will also be declared the winner for betting purposes except when the minimum number of games required for the future to have “action” has not been completed.
